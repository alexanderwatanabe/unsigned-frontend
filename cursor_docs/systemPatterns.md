# System Patterns

## Architecture
- SvelteKit-based frontend application
- File-based routing system
- API routes under src/routes/api
- Component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Reactive state management
- Service-based functionality separation
- Marketplace integration layer
- Composition management system
- History tracking system
- Collection management system

## Current Architecture Focus
### Core Systems
- Gallery and viewing system
- Collection management
- Composition tools
- History tracking
- Marketplace integration
- Performance optimization

### Future Systems (Ethereum Phase)
- Cross-chain migration system
- Blockchain monitoring service
- Dual-chain algorithm execution
- Reminting management system

## Key Technical Decisions
- Use of SvelteKit for modern web framework capabilities
- Tailwind for styling and responsive design
- Vercel for deployment and analytics
- TypeScript for enhanced development experience
- API routes for backend functionality
- Svelte stores for state management
- Service layer for business logic
- Component composition for UI reusability
- JPG.store API integration
- Canvas-based composition system

## Design Patterns
- Component-based UI architecture
- Route-based page organization
- Type-safe development practices
- API-first approach for data handling
- Reactive state management
- Service layer abstraction
- Event-driven architecture
- Dependency injection via services
- Composition pattern for creative tools
- Observer pattern for marketplace updates

## Code Organization
### Components
- Shared components in lib/components
- Page-specific components in routes
- Wallet-related components isolated
- Type-safe props and events
- Composition builder components
- History timeline components
- Personal collection components
- Marketplace integration components
- Gallery view components
- Collection management components

### Services
- Wallet service for blockchain interaction
- State management services
- API integration services
- Utility services
- JPG.store service
- Composition management service
- Asset tracking service
- History management service
- Collection management service
- Gallery service

### State Management
- Centralized store for wallet state
- Reactive stores for UI state
- Persistent state handling
- Type-safe store implementations
- Composition state management
- Marketplace data state
- Personal collection state
- Timeline event state
- Gallery view state
- History tracking state

### Routes
- File-based routing
- API endpoints
- Dynamic routes for NFT pages
- Layout-based page organization
- History page routing
- Personal collection routes
- Composition builder routes
- Marketplace integration routes
- Gallery view routes
- Collection management routes

## Best Practices
- Type safety throughout
- Component composition
- Service abstraction
- State isolation
- Error boundary implementation
- Loading state management
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Marketplace data caching
- Composition state persistence
- Historical data management
- Performance optimization
- Testing coverage
- Documentation standards
- Accessibility compliance

Note: Ethereum-related patterns and architecture will be detailed in a future phase.
