# Active Context

## Current Task
- Implementing keyboard shortcuts for better UX
- Added ESC key to close drawer
- Maintaining consistent keyboard navigation patterns

## Recent Changes
1. Added ESC key functionality:
   - Added ESC key handler to close drawer
   - Prioritized ESC handling before other shortcuts
   - Added early return to prevent other shortcuts when ESC is used

2. Drawer can now be closed via:
   - ESC key
   - × button
   - 'e' key toggle

3. Previous Changes (Monochrome Feature):
   - Added monochrome view type and state management
   - Created subcollections section in drawer
   - Added keyboard shortcut 'm' for monochromes

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding counts to subcollection buttons (e.g., "no-liners (32)")
2. Add loading states for subcollection transitions
3. Consider adding preview images for subcollections
4. Add tooltips explaining each subcollection type
5. Consider adding more subcollections based on other unique properties

## Current Issues
None pending

## Notes
- Keyboard shortcuts now follow a consistent pattern:
  * 'e' - toggle drawer
  * ESC - close drawer
  * 'm' - monochromes
  * 'n' - no-liners
  * 'r' - random
  * ←/→ - pagination
- All shortcuts respect input field focus
- Monochrome detection script successfully identifies both RGB triplets and color doublets
- Gallery page now has three main sections: search, filters, and subcollections
- All special views (monochrome, no-liners, random) maintain consistent pagination behavior
