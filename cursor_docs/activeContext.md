# Active Context

## Current Task
- Implementing special collection views in the gallery page
- Added monochrome feature alongside no-liners
- Reorganized drawer controls for better UX

## Recent Changes
1. Added monochrome feature:
   - Imports monochrome data from `src/assets/monochromes.json`
   - Added monochrome view type and state management
   - Added `showMonochromes()` function
   - Added keyboard shortcut 'm' for quick access

2. Reorganized gallery drawer:
   - Created "subcollections" section at bottom of drawer
   - Grouped monochrome and no-liner buttons together
   - Added random button below on separate line
   - Simplified button text and layout

3. UI/UX Improvements:
   - Consistent button styling across subcollections
   - Keyboard shortcuts highlighted with rainbow animation
   - Responsive layout with flex containers
   - Clear visual hierarchy in drawer sections

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding counts to subcollection buttons (e.g., "no-liners (32)")
2. Add loading states for subcollection transitions
3. Consider adding preview images for subcollections
4. Add tooltips explaining each subcollection type
5. Consider adding more subcollections based on other unique properties

## Current Issues
None pending

## Notes
- Monochrome detection script successfully identifies both RGB triplets and color doublets
- Gallery page now has three main sections: search, filters, and subcollections
- All special views (monochrome, no-liners, random) maintain consistent pagination behavior
