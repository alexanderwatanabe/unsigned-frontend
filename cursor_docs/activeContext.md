9. Ethereum migration system (Future Phase)

## Current Work

We've implemented a sophisticated filtering system for the gallery that:
- allows users to search for unsigs with specific property combinations
- supports multiple filter rows, each representing a set of properties that must exist together in the same layer
- maintains proper state management and error handling
- integrates with the existing id search functionality

## Recent Changes

1. Filtering system:
   - implemented multi-row filtering where each row represents properties that must exist in the same layer
   - fixed filtering logic to always start from the complete dataset
   - added proper type safety and error handling
   - improved property name handling and mapping

2. UI improvements:
   - added clear visual separation between filter rows
   - implemented add/remove filter row functionality
   - styled filter buttons with hover effects
   - maintained consistent lowercase styling except for acronyms

3. Technical updates:
   - updated to svelte 5 rune syntax
   - improved type safety throughout
   - enhanced error handling
   - optimized filter performance

4. Gallery layout improvements:
   - set gallery height to 60vh
   - made gallery width match height for perfect square
   - positioned gallery below navbar with proper spacing
   - removed borders and shadows for cleaner look

5. Navigation improvements:
   - fixed navbar to stay at top of screen
   - positioned next/previous buttons outside gallery area
   - ensured proper z-indexing between navbar and gallery
   - removed scroll-based scaling effect

6. Loading states improvements:
   - added loading overlay for page transitions
   - implemented image prefetching for adjacent pages
   - improved error handling during page loads

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding:
   - filter presets for common combinations
   - ability to save favorite filters
   - visual indicators for active filters
   - filter statistics/analytics

2. Potential optimizations:
   - client-side caching of filter results
   - lazy loading of filtered results
   - batch processing for large result sets

3. User experience:
   - add tooltips explaining filter behavior
   - improve feedback on filter matches
   - consider adding filter suggestions

4. Known issues:
   - mobile layout needs optimization
   - filter ui could be more intuitive
   - loading states could be more informative
   - need to implement error boundaries

5. Dependencies:
   - svelte 5 runes for state management
   - tailwind for utility classes
   - vercel for deployment and analytics
   - aws s3 for image storage

## Current Focus
- Implementing wallet integration with metamask
- Implementing gallery layout improvements and navigation
- Optimizing user experience with smooth transitions and responsive design

## Recent Changes
- Implemented basic wallet connection ui
- Added placeholder wallet state management
- Created initial wallet service layer
- Updated gallery layout to be square and responsive
- Improved navigation
- Enhanced loading states

## Next Steps
1. Complete metamask integration
   - Implement wallet connection
   - Handle transactions
   - Manage wallet state
2. Optimize image loading performance
   - Implement progressive image loading
   - Add placeholder images during load
   - Optimize image sizes based on viewport
3. Enhance filter functionality
   - Add visual feedback for active filters
   - Implement filter combinations
   - Add filter presets
4. Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Adapt gallery layout for smaller screens
   - Optimize touch interactions
   - Enhance navigation for mobile users

## Current State
- Basic wallet ui implemented
- Gallery displays nfts in a square grid
- Navigation buttons positioned outside gallery
- Fixed navbar with proper z-indexing
- Lazy loading and prefetching implemented
- Filter system operational with multiple criteria
- Random mode and id search working

## Known Issues
- Wallet integration incomplete
- Mobile layout needs optimization
- Filter ui could be more intuitive
- Loading states could be more informative
- Need to implement error boundaries

## Dependencies
- Svelte 5 runes for state management
- Tailwind for utility classes
- Vercel for deployment and analytics
- AWS S3 for image storage

## Current Work
working on the gallery component to:
1. fix infinite loop in effect handling
2. resolve loading state issues
3. improve state management
4. ensure proper url syncing

## Recent Changes
1. consolidated effects into single handler
2. added proper guards for state updates
3. improved loading state management
4. fixed url synchronization
5. added navigation controls
6. implemented filter system
7. added random mode

## Next Steps
1. fix remaining effect loop issues
2. improve error handling
3. add keyboard navigation
4. optimize image loading
5. enhance accessibility
6. add loading indicators
7. implement retry mechanisms

## Current Issues
1. infinite loop in effect handling
2. loading overlay persists
3. url updates causing loops
4. state updates triggering multiple effects

## Debugging Notes
1. effect loop caused by:
   - circular dependencies in effects
   - url updates triggering state changes
   - state changes triggering url updates

2. loading state issues:
   - not properly reset after navigation
   - persists after data loaded
   - needs better cleanup

3. state management:
   - needs better separation of concerns
   - reduce effect dependencies
   - improve state update batching

4. url handling:
   - better sync with state
   - prevent unnecessary updates
   - handle navigation properly
