# Active Context

## Current Work
- Optimizing animation system in the NFT viewer
- Working on `animation` branch (tagged as WIP)
- Focus on improving performance and visual quality of layer animations

## Recent Changes
1. Animation System Optimization:
   - Reduced animation resolution to 1024x1024 for better performance
   - Implemented row/column-based animation processing
   - Added willReadFrequently attribute to canvas context
   - Optimized buffer handling using 1D arrays

2. Code Structure:
   - Refactored PropertyBuffer interface to use 1D arrays
   - Improved memory efficiency in animation processing
   - Enhanced direction-based processing (vertical/horizontal)

## Next Steps
1. Animation Improvements:
   - Test performance with new buffer system
   - Verify visual quality at 1024x1024
   - Consider adding progress indicators
   - Optimize frame generation and capture

2. Code Quality:
   - Add TypeScript type safety improvements
   - Document new animation system
   - Add performance metrics
   - Consider adding unit tests

## Current Issues
- Need to verify aliasing at 1024x1024 resolution
- Monitor memory usage with new buffer system
- Ensure smooth transitions between layers

## Branch Status
- Main branch: stable
- Animation branch: WIP
  - Purpose: Animation system optimization
  - Status: In development
  - Changes: Buffer optimization, resolution adjustment

## Current Task
- Implementing keyboard shortcuts for better UX
- Added ESC key to close drawer
- Maintaining consistent keyboard navigation patterns

## Recent Changes
1. Added ESC key functionality:
   - Added ESC key handler to close drawer
   - Prioritized ESC handling before other shortcuts
   - Added early return to prevent other shortcuts when ESC is used

2. Drawer can now be closed via:
   - ESC key
   - × button
   - 'e' key toggle

3. Previous Changes (Monochrome Feature):
   - Added monochrome view type and state management
   - Created subcollections section in drawer
   - Added keyboard shortcut 'm' for monochromes

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding counts to subcollection buttons (e.g., "no-liners (32)")
2. Add loading states for subcollection transitions
3. Consider adding preview images for subcollections
4. Add tooltips explaining each subcollection type
5. Consider adding more subcollections based on other unique properties

## Current Issues
None pending

## Notes
- Keyboard shortcuts now follow a consistent pattern:
  * 'e' - toggle drawer
  * ESC - close drawer
  * 'm' - monochromes
  * 'n' - no-liners
  * 'r' - random
  * ←/→ - pagination
- All shortcuts respect input field focus
- Monochrome detection script successfully identifies both RGB triplets and color doublets
- Gallery page now has three main sections: search, filters, and subcollections
- All special views (monochrome, no-liners, random) maintain consistent pagination behavior
