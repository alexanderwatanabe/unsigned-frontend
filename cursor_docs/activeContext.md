# Active Context

## Current Task
Fixing database connection issues in Vercel deployment and improving error handling for missing environment variables.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed database connection issues by implementing a more resilient approach to handling missing environment variables
- Added fallback for when POSTGRES_URL is not set to prevent build failures
- Replaced hardcoded database connection strings with environment variable references
- Implemented proper error handling for database operations when connection is not available
- Added early returns with appropriate error messages for database API endpoints
- Improved TypeScript type safety with explicit types and non-null assertions
- Fixed linter errors related to invalid TypeScript types in database query results

## Previous Task
Enhancing the arrangements page with improved UI interactions and user experience:
- Implemented mouseover display of unsig numbers in the arrangements page grid
- Added links from hovering unsigs to their detail pages at /nft/[id]
- Ensured unsig numbers are properly zero-padded with 5 digits (#00123)
- Added a copy button for transaction IDs to replace alert popup
- Simplified the grid display with a clean black overlay on hover
- Improved mobile responsiveness for hover interactions
- Removed unnecessary composition details modal for a simpler user experience

## Next Steps

### Critical Deployment Tasks
1. Vercel Configuration:
   - Add POSTGRES_URL environment variable to Vercel project settings
   - Value: `postgres://neondb_owner:npg_GoYmh8Iknz0f@ep-delicate-shadow-a2mhoq1s-pooler.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`
   - Apply to Production, Preview, and Development environments
   - Redeploy the application after setting environment variables

2. Database Code Standardization:
   - Consider updating all database files to use SvelteKit's `$env/static/private` approach
   - Resolve TypeScript module resolution for `$env/static/private`
   - Ensure consistent error handling across all database files

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Arrangements Page Enhancements:
   - Consider adding filtering options for compositions
   - Implement sorting options (date, complexity, etc.)
   - Add pagination for large numbers of compositions
   - Consider image lazy loading for performance

2. Interaction Polishing:
   - Add animation for hover transitions
   - Consider shared composition functionality
   - Add keyboard navigation for grid
   - Consider infinite scroll loading

3. Mobile Optimizations:
   - Enhance touch interactions for mobile
   - Optimize layout for different screen sizes
   - Ensure consistent experience across devices

### Feature Development
1. Gallery Integration:
   - Ensure consistent UI patterns between gallery and arrangements
   - Consider unified design language
   - Implement shared components where applicable

2. Blockchain Integration:
   - Improve transaction handling
   - Add better error handling for blockchain operations
   - Consider on-chain data validation

## Implementation Order
1. Complete Vercel environment variable configuration
2. Standardize database connection approach
3. Finalize arrangements page hover effects
4. Implement sorting and filtering
5. Add pagination or infinite scroll
6. Optimize performance with lazy loading
7. Enhance mobile-specific interactions

## Technical Requirements
- Proper environment variable management for sensitive data
- Resilient error handling for database operations
- Consistent styling between pages
- Optimized images for different viewport sizes
- Proper zero-padding for unsig IDs
- Clean link handling between pages
- Effective clipboard API usage

## Development Focus
- Clean, consistent user experience
- Responsive and accessible design
- Performance optimization
- Intuitive interactions
- Proper error handling

## Notes
- Maintain consistent styling (lowercase, JetBrains Mono)
- Ensure layouts are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes
- Focus on performance especially for arrangements with many unsigs
- Provide clear visual feedback for user actions 
- SvelteKit environment variables should be accessed via `$env/static/private` in server-side code
