# Active Context

## Current Task
Enhancing the arrangements page with improved UI interactions and user experience.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented mouseover display of unsig numbers in the arrangements page grid
- Added links from hovering unsigs to their detail pages at /nft/[id]
- Ensured unsig numbers are properly zero-padded with 5 digits (#00123)
- Added a copy button for transaction IDs to replace alert popup
- Simplified the grid display with a clean black overlay on hover
- Improved mobile responsiveness for hover interactions
- Removed unnecessary composition details modal for a simpler user experience

## Next Steps

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Arrangements Page Enhancements:
   - Consider adding filtering options for compositions
   - Implement sorting options (date, complexity, etc.)
   - Add pagination for large numbers of compositions
   - Consider image lazy loading for performance

2. Interaction Polishing:
   - Add animation for hover transitions
   - Consider shared composition functionality
   - Add keyboard navigation for grid
   - Consider infinite scroll loading

3. Mobile Optimizations:
   - Enhance touch interactions for mobile
   - Optimize layout for different screen sizes
   - Ensure consistent experience across devices

### Feature Development
1. Gallery Integration:
   - Ensure consistent UI patterns between gallery and arrangements
   - Consider unified design language
   - Implement shared components where applicable

2. Blockchain Integration:
   - Improve transaction handling
   - Add better error handling for blockchain operations
   - Consider on-chain data validation

## Implementation Order
1. Finalize arrangements page hover effects
2. Implement sorting and filtering
3. Add pagination or infinite scroll
4. Optimize performance with lazy loading
5. Enhance mobile-specific interactions

## Technical Requirements
- Consistent styling between pages
- Optimized images for different viewport sizes
- Proper zero-padding for unsig IDs
- Clean link handling between pages
- Effective clipboard API usage
