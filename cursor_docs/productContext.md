# Product Context

## Purpose
This is the frontend for the unsigned_algorithms project, a gallery/showcase application built with SvelteKit that enables users to interact with generative art algorithms. The initial focus is on the Cardano implementation, with future plans for Ethereum integration.

## Problems Solved
Current Focus:
- Provides a user interface for viewing and interacting with unsigned algorithms
- Serves as a gallery for algorithmic art display
- Integrates with Cardano blockchain for storing algorithm blueprints
- Enables users to connect their Cardano wallets and interact with NFTs
- Provides a modern, responsive interface for digital art exploration
- Allows users to manage and view their personal collection
- Enables creative composition of unsigs
- Provides marketplace integration for asset management
- Documents project history and significant events

Future Ethereum Phase:
- Facilitates migration of unsigs from Cardano to Ethereum
- Enables cross-chain ownership verification
- Provides seamless blockchain transition experience
- Enables on-chain execution of algorithms on Ethereum
- Allows users to optionally store generated outputs on Ethereum
- Provides secure reminting process from Cardano to Ethereum

## Core Concepts
### Current Implementation (Cardano)
- Algorithms stored as blueprints
- Code stored on-chain but executed off-chain
- Like architectural plans for a building
- Requires external computation

### Future Implementation (Ethereum)
- Executable algorithms in EVM
- View functions for preview generation
- Optional on-chain output storage
- True on-chain generative art
- Migration from Cardano support

## Current Focus: Core Features
- Gallery and viewing system
- Personal collection management
- Composition tools
- Project history tracking
- Marketplace integration
- Performance optimization
- Testing and documentation

## Expected Functionality
Current Phase:

- Analytics integration via Vercel
- Type-safe development environment
- Secure blockchain interactions
- Personal collection management ("My Unsigs")
- Composition builder for creating unsig arrangements
- JPG.store integration for offer tracking
- Project history timeline and events
- Collection filtering and organization tools

Future Ethereum Phase:
- Cross-chain migration system
