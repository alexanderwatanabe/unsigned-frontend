    <h2>a question</h2>
    <p>
      unsigned_algorithms started as a question: "why would anyone buy a link to a jpg?"
      the solution was to make something that was more than a link, or reference, but rather
      intrinsically was something in and of itself.
    </p>

    <h2>the collection</h2>
    <p>
      unsigned_algorithms is a work that explores the boundary between cultural creation and
      technology. it starts with its genesis piece: 00000 - a piece with no properties itself,
      but holding the code which generates the output of the other 31,118 pieces. every other piece
      in the collection contains a set of "properties" (digital dna) which when passed to the code
      in the 00000 produces a color field.
    </p>

    <h2>the technology</h2>
    <p>
      each nft contains not just a link to an image, but a reference to the actual code that generates 
      its unique color field. if a typical nft is like the deed to a house, then each piece in this work
      is more like the blueprint to a house.
