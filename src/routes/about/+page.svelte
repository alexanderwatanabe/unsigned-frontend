    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>
      unsigned_algorithms is a conceptual art project that explores the intersection of 
      generative art and blockchain technology. Each piece in the collection is more 
      than just a static image - it's a unique algorithm that generates abstract RGB 
      color fields.

    <h2>The Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Each NFT contains not just a link to an image, but the actual code that generates 
      the unique color field. This makes each piece a true digital artifact, where the 
      image is inseparable from its generating algorithm.

    <h2>The Collection</h2>
    <p>
      The collection consists of 31,119 unique pieces, each generated using different 
      parameters and algorithms. The variety in the collection showcases the vast 
      possibilities of algorithmic art.
