    <h2>A Question</h2>
    <p>
        unsigned_algorithms started as a question: "Why would anyone buy a link to a JPG?"
        The solution was to make something that was more than a link, or reference, but rather
        intrinsically was something in and of itself"
    </p>

    <h2>The Collection</h2>
    <p>
      unsigned_algorithms is a work that explores the boundary between cultural creation and
      technology. It starts with its genesis piece: 00000 - a piece with no properties itself,
      but holding the code which generates the output of the other 31,118 pieces. Every other piece
      in the collection contains a set of "properties" (digital DNA) which when passed to the code
      in the 00000 produces a color field.

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Each NFT contains not just a link to an image, but a reference to the  actual code that generates 
      its unique color field. If a typical NFT is like the deed to a house, then each piece in this work
      is more like the blueprint to a house.
