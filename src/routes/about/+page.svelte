      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        unsigned_algorithms started as a question: "why would anyone buy a link to a JPG?"
        the solution was to make something that was more than a link, or reference, but rather
        intrinsically was something in and of itself.

        unsigned_algorithms is a work that explores the boundary between cultural creation and
        technology. it starts with its genesis piece: 00000 - a piece with no properties itself,
        but holding the code which generates the output of the other 31,118 pieces. every other piece
        in the collection contains a set of "properties" (digital DNA) which when passed to the code
        in the 00000 produces a color field.

        each NFT contains not just a link to an image, but a reference to the actual code that generates 
        its unique color field. if a typical NFT is like the deed to a house, then each piece in this work
        is more like the blueprint to a house.
